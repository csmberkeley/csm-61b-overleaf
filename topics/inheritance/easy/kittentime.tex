\question

Consider the following interface and implementing class:

\begin{lstlisting}

interface Kitten {
    public String favorite_toy();
    public String best_friend();
    
    default void play_time() {
        System.out.println("Playing with " + favorite_toy() + " & " + best_friend() + "!");
    }
}

class BabyKitten implements Kitten {
    @Override
    public String favorite_toy() {
        return "lasers";
    }

    @Override
    public String best_friend() {
        return "Kelvin the kitten";
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{parts}
\begin{blocksection}
\part Do we need a \lstinline{play_time} method in \lstinline{BabyKitten} in order to make a BabyKitten have playtime?
\begin{solution}[1in]
No, we do not need the \lstinline{play_time} method because it is already defined as a default method in the \lstinline{Kitten} interface.
Java will look up the parent's (which in this case is an interface) method if it cannot find one in the child class.
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}

\begin{blocksection}
\part What does the following two lines print?
\begin{lstlisting}
Kitten kitty = new BabyKitten();
kitty.play_time();
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\lstinline{Playing with lasers & Kelvin the kitten!}

Even though \lstinline{favorite_toy} and \lstinline{best_friend} are not implemented
in \lstinline{Kitten}, they are implemented within the \lstinline{BabyKitten} class, which will be looked
up by Java.
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}


\begin{blocksection}
\part Now let's suppose we define a new class that inherits from \lstinline{Kitten} and attempt to run a few lines of code:
\begin{lstlisting}
class AdultKitty implements Kitten {
    @Override
    public String favorite_toy() {
        return "stuffed mouse";
    }
}

Kitten adult = new AdultKitty();
adult.play_time();
\end{lstlisting}
Do these lines error? Is it a compile-time or run-time error?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
These lines result in a compile-time error. Some students may be tempted into saying it is a run-time error,
since when the \lstinline{play_time} method in \lstinline{Kitten} looks for \lstinline{AdultKitten}'s \lstinline{best_friend} method,
it sees that the method is not implemented. Keep in mind that compile-time always comes before run-time, so \lstinline{adult.play_time()} actually never runs!

However, it is important to keep in mind that an implementing class must implement all methods declared in its parent interface.
As a result, the Java compiler will see that \lstinline{best_friend} is not implemented, triggering a compile-time error.
This is where IntelliJ's "does not override" warning comes from.
\end{solution}
