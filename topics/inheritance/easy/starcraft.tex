Consider the following interface and implementing class:

\begin{lstlisting}

interface Worker {
    public String favorite_resource();
    public String favorite_phrase();
    
    default void work() {
        System.out.println("Gathering " + favorite_resource() + ". " + favorite_phrase());
    }
}

// Note: SCV stands for "Space Construction Vehicle"
class SCV implements Worker {
    @Override
    public String favorite_resource() {
        return "Minerals";
    }

    @Override
    public String favorite_phrase() {
        return "Woohoo! Overtime!";
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{parts}
\begin{blocksection}
\part Do we need a \lstinline{work} method in \lstinline{SCV} in order to make an SCV work?
\begin{solution}[1in]
No, we do not need the \lstinline{work} method because it is already defined as a default method in the \lstinline{Worker} interface.
Java will look up the parent's (which in this case is an interface) method if it cannot find one in the child class.
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}

\begin{blocksection}
\part What does the following two lines print?
\begin{lstlisting}
Worker scv = new SCV();
scv.work();
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\lstinline{Gathering Minerals. Woohoo, Overtime!}

Even though \lstinline{favorite_resource} and \lstinline{favorite_phrase} are not implemented
in \lstinline{Worker}, they are implemented within the \lstinline{SCV} class, which will be looked
up by Java.
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}


\begin{blocksection}
\part Now let's suppose we define a new class that inherits from \lstinline{Worker} and attempt to run a few lines of code:
\begin{lstlisting}
class Probe implements Worker {
    @Override
    public String favorite_resource() {
        return "Vespene Gas";
    }
}

Worker probe = new Probe();
probe.work();
\end{lstlisting}
Do these lines error? Is it a compile-time or run-time error?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
These lines result in a compile-time error. Some students may be tempted into saying it is a run-time error,
since when the \lstinline{work} method in \lstinline{Worker} looks for \lstinline{Probe}'s \lstinline{favorite_phrase} method,
it sees that the method is not implemented. Keep in mind that compile-time always comes before run-time, so \lstinline{probe.work()} actually never runs!

However, it is important to keep in mind that an implementing class must implement all methods declared in its parent interface.
As a result, the Java compiler will see that \lstinline{favorite_phrase} is not implemented, triggering a compile-time error.
This is where IntelliJ's "does not override" warning comes from.
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}
