So far, we've learned a few different types of basic sorting algorithms. While
sorting might seem like a simple idea, there are many real-world applications of
sorting, and several different algorithms that we can use depending on the situation.\\
In the table below, fill out the best and worst-case runtimes for each of the sorting algorithms provided.\\
If applicable, also take note of what kind of list formats might make certain algorithms better or worse in certain cases even if their worst-case runtime is the same or worse than another algorithm.
