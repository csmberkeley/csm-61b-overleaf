Suppose that we have a list of $N$ words, where $R$ is the size of the alphabet (radix), and $W$ is the length of the longest word. Fill in the table below with each sort's runtime and stability:

{
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{12pt}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{Xlll}
Algorithm         & Best-case       & Worst-case          & Stable \\\hline
Counting Sort     &                 &                     &        \\
LSD Radix Sort    &                 &                     &        \\
MSD Radix Sort    &                 &                     &
\end{tabularx}
}
\fi

\begin{solution}
{
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{12pt}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{Xlll}
Algorithm         & Best-case          & Worst-case          & Stable? \\\hline
Counting Sort     & $\Theta(N + R)$    & $\Theta(N + R)$     & Yes    \\
LSD Radix Sort    & $\Theta(W(N + R))$ & $\Theta(W(N + R))$  & Yes    \\
MSD Radix Sort    & $\Theta(N + R)$    & $\Theta(W(N + R))$  & Yes
\end{tabularx}
}

Where $N$ is the length of the list, $R$ is the size of the alphabet (radix),
and $W$ is the length of the longest word.

Extra: MSD radix sort is stable when implemented with additional space for a buffer.
\end{solution}
