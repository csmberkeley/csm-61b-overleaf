\question Give a best and worst case input for insertion sort.

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Best case is a completely sorted array with 0 inversions with runtime $\Theta(N)$.
The worst case is a reverse-sorted array with $\Theta(N^2)$ inversions. Recall that the
runtime for insertion sort is given by $\Theta(N + K)$ where $K$ is the number
of inversions.
\end{solution}
