\question In Heapsort, do we use a min-heap or max-heap? Why?

\\

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
We use a max-heap because then we can fill in the array of sorted elements from the back to the front in the same array we use to represent our heap. In other words, it allows us to use less memory by sorting in the same array.
