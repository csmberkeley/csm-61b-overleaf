\question We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0). (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)\newline\newline
You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)\newline\newline 
\textbf{Example}\newline 
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2\newline
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]\newline
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)\newline\newline 
This problem is taken from Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

\begin{solution}[1in]
\textbf{Intuition}\newline
Sort the points by distance, then take the closest K points.\newline\newline
\textbf{Algorithm}\newline
In Java, we find the K-th distance by creating an array of distances and then sorting them. After, we select all the points with distance less than or equal to this K-th distance.\newline\newline 
\begin{lstlisting}
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        int N = points.length;
        int[] dists = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            dists[i] = dist(points[i]);

        Arrays.sort(dists);
        int distK = dists[K-1];

        int[][] ans = new int[K][2];
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            if (dist(points[i]) <= distK)
                ans[t++] = points[i];
        return ans;
    }

    public int dist(int[] point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
