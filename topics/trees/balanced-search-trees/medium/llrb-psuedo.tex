\emph{After spending a long night doing 61B Homework, I couldn't help but wonder... Are there real "red-black" trees? After much research, I stumbled upon the Black Diamond Crepe Myrtle, a real black-leaved tree with red flowers that isn't a data structure. }

Here is a refresher on inserting into a red-black tree:
\begin{parts}
\item Sort the new node into the tree as if the tree was a BST. The edge from the new node connecting it to its parent is always red. 

\item Starting from the new node, recursively iterate upwards checking for the following issues at each step. 

\subitem 1) If the two children of the node are both connected to the node         with a red edge, flip all the colors of edges touching the node. 

\subitem 2) If the edge to the left child, and the edge connecting the left         child to its left child are both red, rotate the branch right on the node. 

\subitem 3) If the edge to the right child of the node is red and the edge         to the left child is black, rotate left on the node.

\subitem 4) If none of these problems occur, return and recurse on the             parent node.
