\begin{itemize}
\item If there are $N$ terms in the sequence $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \cdots, N$, or $N / C$ terms in the sequence for some constant, $C$. 
\subitem $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + \cdots + N \in \Theta(N^2)$
\item If there are $\log_{2} N$ terms in the sequence $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \cdots, N$, or $\log_{2} N / C$ terms for some constant, $C$.
\subitem $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \cdots + N \in \Theta(N)$
\subitem Or, the number of nodes in a bushy tree is equal to $k^{h}$ where $k$ is the
branching factor and $h$ is the height of the tree
\subitem Remember: All logarithms are proportional to each other by the Change of Base
formula.
