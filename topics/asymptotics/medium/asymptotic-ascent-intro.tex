The functions \lstinline{f()}, \lstinline{g()}, and \lstinline{h()} are a set of mystery functions that all take a single input parameter, which is an integer array. We know that \lstinline{f()} runs in $\Theta(N)$ time, \lstinline{g()} runs in $\Theta(N^2)$ time, and \lstinline{h()} runs in $O(N^2)$ time, and we also know that each function returns an output integer array of the same length as its input.
