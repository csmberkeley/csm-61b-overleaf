\question The cut property states that given any cut (meaning a setting where all vertices are added to one of two groupings, you can think of it like coloring every vertex either red or blue), the minimum weight crossing edge between the two groups is in an MST. The converse is also true, that if an edge is in the MST, then it must be the minimum weight crossing edge across some cut. This property is a key idea behind Prim's algorithm.\\
