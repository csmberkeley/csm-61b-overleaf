\question Construct a minimum spanning tree by running Kruskal's Algorithm. 

Break ties alphabetically: if you have the choice between two edges with the same weight, pick the one that has the smallest alphabetical vertex. If they both share a vertex which is the smallest alphabetical value, pick the one whose second vertex is smaller. Provide the ordering in which you broke ties, and order them alphabetically by vertex. For example if you break an edge between vertex Z and Y or vice versa, call it YZ.\\
