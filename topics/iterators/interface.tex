In Java, an \define{iterator} is an object which allows us to traverse a data
structure. This can be helpful if we'd like to loop through every element in said data structure,
and allows us to take advantage of Java's enhanced \lstinline{for} loops. 
Every iterator has two methods: \lstinline$hasNext$ and \lstinline$next$.

\begin{lstlisting}
interface Iterator<E> {
    boolean hasNext();
    E next();
}
\end{lstlisting}
